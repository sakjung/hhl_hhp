# Hiphople & Hiphopplaya


## Introduction

[`Hiphople`](http://hiphople.com/) and [`Hiphopplaya`](https://hiphopplaya.com/) are the two main Hip-Hop community web sites in South Korea. These two web sites have dynamically changing web pages so that it is difficult to scrape required data with only simple techniques. This project used Selenium and R to dynamically crawl the two web pages and and retrieve necessary data of user posts.
